## About 

Procedurally generated video game made in Unity. Made this at Beach Hacks with 3 friends (William Clemons, Yash Narang, and Derek Evans) under 24 hours. None of us have ever made a game before, so this was a nice introduction. A special thanks to the [Lets Make A Game Together](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNERyi31iYKR45W-k917iZ5_sSS-CU-r1) Youtube channel for guiding us in making a procedurally generated video game.

If you want to test it now you can download the zip, extract it, open the root folder in unity, and build the project. You hold the space bar to go up, release the space bar to go down.
